1. Describe the problem: 
LOCAL BANK comes to us and asked: How can we market accurate type of cards (payment instrument) to a customer that suits his/her spending routines?

ME as Data Scientist: We need to collect data to analyze who suits which type of payment instrument![Debit Card, Gold Credit Card, Platinum Credit Card]

2. Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data: 

At what level of customer's income and expenses are you (the LOCAL BANK) willing to issue Credit Cards?

1. ANALYTICS APPROACH 

First, we want to understand our current customers

We choose the DESCRIPTIVE and DIAGNOSTIC to statistically understand the demographic of the current customers' demographic, included: 
Income: What are their range of income? [number $'000]
Expenses: How much they spend everymonth? [number $'000]
Age & genders: How old are they and what are their genders? [integer xx, dummy variable Male = 1 Female = 0, others = 3] 
Location: Where do they live [dummy variable]
Current payment instrument: What are the current type of cards they have? [dummy variable]

Second, we use Machine Learning Algorithm to identify relationship and trends in the data, using Clustering and Association approaches.


2. DATA REQUIREMENTS

Data from banking industry, 
i. Loyalty: At least 1 year to make sure he/she satisfy with the current instrument.

ii. Location: in big cities so that purchasing habits is more reliable.

iii. Age: greater than 18 but less than 70. We don't market to children or people older than 80

iv. Banking industry must be in the local areas to ensure the analysis relevant to client's requirement.

3. DATA COLLECTION

i. Data can be collected from LOCAL BANK databases

ii. Data can be collected from the National Bureau of Statistics

iii. Data can be collected by sending out the survey to the mass populations.

iv. Using descriptive statistics and visualisation techniques to test data quality.

v. Decided whether the amount of data is enough. If not, collect more, if don't, move to the next steps. 

Note: at this stage it is important to ask client what level of accuracy they want, whether 67%, 90%, 95% or 97%, to determine the size of sample collections.

4. DATA UDNERSTANDING AND PREPARATION

i. DATA UNDERSTANDING: Run Descriptive Analysis to access data quality including: Univariate Statistics, Pairwise Correlations and Histogram to understand the distribution.

ii. DATE PREPARATION: 
#### Data Duplication issues: If we combine data from many different banks, there's might be duplicated data as one customer can have many cards
#### Invalid Data issues: There are sub-owner of the cards. For example: children under 18 might have a sub-account associated with their parents. Therefore, the children's data should not be in our table.

#### Formated the data: 
Income = int [$'000]
Expense = int [$'000]
Age = int [years: 18< n <80]
Genders = dummy variables [1,0]
Location = dummy variables [Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart] = [MEL, SYD, ADE, BRB, HBA]
Types of Cards = [Debit, Gold Credit, Platinum Credit] = [DEB, GCR, PCR]

5. MODELING AND EVALUATION

i. Purpose of modeling: Identify the customer financial behaviors and payment instrument they choose. Using descriptive model with machine learning driven

ii. MODELING: base on the descriptive result, construct variables that seems to most affect the customer choice of credit card: income, spending, gender, location,...  

iii. EVALUATION: because descriptive model applied, one of the relationships will be assessed and a testing set with know outcomes can be applied and the model can be refined as needed.

Then, use statistical significance testing to ensure data is properly handled and interpreted within the model. USing ROC curve

Consider the following:
Classification model performances
True- positive rate and false-positive rate.

We want the true-positive rate is high but it is also important that the false-positive rate is low. 

Optimum choice will be based on ROC Curve, the further from diagonal line, the better model is.
